# Production Rollback Strategy and Emergency Procedures

## Overview
This document outlines the rollback strategy and emergency procedures for the license plate template feature deployment. The strategy covers multiple scenarios and provides clear steps for rapid recovery.

## Rollback Triggers

### Automatic Rollback Conditions
- App crash rate increases by >5% from baseline
- Database migration failure rate >1%
- Performance degradation >20% in key metrics
- Feature functionality completely broken (>90% failure rate)

### Manual Rollback Decisions
- User complaints exceed threshold (>50 negative reviews/day)
- Critical bug discovered affecting core functionality
- Security vulnerability identified
- Business decision to disable feature

## Rollback Strategies

### 1. Feature Flag Rollback (Fastest - 5 minutes)
**Use Case:** Feature is causing issues but app is stable

```kotlin
// Emergency feature flag disable
object FeatureFlags {
    const val LICENSE_PLATE_TEMPLATES_ENABLED = false // Set to false immediately
    
    // Runtime override capability
    fun isTemplateFeatureEnabled(): Boolean {
        // Check remote config for emergency disable
        return LICENSE_PLATE_TEMPLATES_ENABLED && 
               !RemoteConfig.getBoolean("emergency_disable_templates", false)
    }
}
```

**Steps:**
1. Update remote config to disable templates
2. Force app refresh or wait for next app launch
3. Verify feature is disabled via monitoring
4. Monitor for improvement in metrics

### 2. App Version Rollback (Medium - 30 minutes)
**Use Case:** Significant issues requiring previous app version

**Prerequisites:**
- Previous stable version available in release artifacts
- Rollback testing completed successfully

**Steps:**
1. **Immediate Response (0-5 minutes):**
   ```bash
   # Stop current release distribution
   # This would be done via Google Play Console manually
   echo "Stop release distribution immediately"
   ```

2. **Prepare Rollback (5-15 minutes):**
   ```bash
   # Checkout previous stable tag
   git checkout v1.1.0  # Replace with last stable version
   
   # Quick verification build
   ./gradlew assembleRelease
   ```

3. **Deploy Rollback (15-30 minutes):**
   - Upload previous version to app stores
   - Update release notes explaining the rollback
   - Notify users about temporary reversion

### 3. Database Schema Rollback (Complex - 1-2 hours)
**Use Case:** Database migration causes data corruption or major issues

**Warning:** This is the most complex rollback scenario and should only be used in critical situations.

```sql
-- Emergency database rollback from v4 to v3
-- CAUTION: This will lose all template-related data
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Drop v4 tables
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS license_plate_templates;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS countries;

-- Remove foreign key references if any were added to existing tables
-- (In this case, only the country column was added to watchlist_entries in v3)

-- Update version back to 3
UPDATE room_master_table SET version = 3;

COMMIT;
```

**Steps:**
1. **Stop all app instances** that might write to database
2. **Backup current database** before rollback
3. **Execute rollback script** on affected users
4. **Deploy app version** compatible with v3 schema
5. **Verify data integrity** after rollback

## Emergency Contact Plan

### Incident Response Team
1. **Primary Contact:** Lead Developer
2. **Secondary Contact:** DevOps Engineer
3. **Business Contact:** Product Manager
4. **Technical Contact:** Database Administrator

### Communication Channels
- **Immediate:** Slack #incidents channel
- **Updates:** Email to stakeholders
- **Public:** App store release notes
- **Users:** In-app notification (if app is functional)

## Monitoring and Alerting During Rollback

### Key Metrics to Monitor
```bash
# Real-time monitoring commands/queries
# (These would be integrated into your monitoring dashboard)

# App crash rate
firebase crashlytics:reports --app-id=YOUR_APP_ID --time-range="1h"

# Performance metrics
firebase performance:reports --trace="app_start" --time-range="1h"

# User engagement
firebase analytics:reports --metric="active_users" --time-range="1h"
```

### Success Criteria for Rollback
- App crash rate returns to baseline within 1 hour
- No new critical bugs reported
- User engagement metrics stabilize
- Database queries perform within acceptable limits

## Rollback Testing Plan

### Pre-Production Testing
1. **Staging Environment Rollback:**
   ```bash
   # Test rollback process in staging
   ./test-rollback-staging.sh
   ```

2. **Database Rollback Simulation:**
   ```bash
   # Test database rollback with test data
   ./test-database-rollback.sh
   ```

3. **Feature Flag Testing:**
   ```bash
   # Test feature flag disable/enable
   ./test-feature-flags.sh
   ```

### Rollback Validation Checklist
- [ ] Previous app version builds successfully
- [ ] Database rollback script tested with production-like data
- [ ] Feature flags can be toggled remotely
- [ ] Monitoring systems detect rollback events
- [ ] Communication templates prepared
- [ ] Rollback automation scripts tested

## Post-Rollback Procedures

### Immediate Actions (0-24 hours)
1. **Root Cause Analysis:**
   - Analyze logs and crash reports
   - Identify the specific issue that triggered rollback
   - Document timeline of events

2. **User Communication:**
   - Update app store descriptions
   - Send in-app notifications explaining the situation
   - Respond to user reviews and support tickets

3. **Data Recovery:**
   - Assess any data loss from rollback
   - Plan data recovery if possible
   - Update users about data implications

### Long-term Actions (1-7 days)
1. **Fix Development:**
   - Develop fix for the issues that caused rollback
   - Thorough testing of the fix
   - Code review and QA approval

2. **Gradual Re-deployment:**
   - Deploy fix to small user segment
   - Monitor metrics carefully
   - Gradual rollout if metrics are positive

3. **Process Improvement:**
   - Update deployment procedures
   - Improve testing coverage
   - Enhance monitoring and alerting

## Rollback Automation Scripts

### Feature Flag Emergency Disable
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# emergency-disable-templates.sh

echo "üö® EMERGENCY: Disabling license plate templates feature"

# Update remote config (pseudo-code - adapt to your remote config system)
firebase remote-config:set emergency_disable_templates true

# Force refresh for active users
firebase messaging:send --topic="all_users" --data='{"force_refresh": true}'

echo "‚úÖ Feature disabled. Monitor metrics for improvement."
```

### Version Rollback Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# emergency-version-rollback.sh

PREVIOUS_VERSION=${1:-"v1.1.0"}

echo "üö® EMERGENCY: Rolling back to version $PREVIOUS_VERSION"

# Checkout previous version
git checkout $PREVIOUS_VERSION

# Build emergency release
./gradlew assembleRelease

echo "‚úÖ Rollback build ready. Upload to app stores manually."
```

### Health Check Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# health-check-post-rollback.sh

echo "üîç Performing post-rollback health check..."

# Check app crash rate
CRASH_RATE=$(get-crash-rate-last-hour)  # Implement based on your monitoring
echo "Current crash rate: $CRASH_RATE%"

# Check performance metrics
RESPONSE_TIME=$(get-avg-response-time)  # Implement based on your monitoring
echo "Average response time: ${RESPONSE_TIME}ms"

# Check feature availability
TEMPLATE_FEATURE_ENABLED=$(check-template-feature-status)
echo "Template feature enabled: $TEMPLATE_FEATURE_ENABLED"

if [ "$CRASH_RATE" -lt 2 ] && [ "$RESPONSE_TIME" -lt 1000 ]; then
    echo "‚úÖ Health check passed. Rollback successful."
    exit 0
else
    echo "‚ùå Health check failed. Further investigation required."
    exit 1
fi
```

## Recovery Planning

### Data Recovery Scenarios
1. **Template Data Loss:**
   - Re-initialize default templates
   - Import templates from configuration files
   - Guide users through template setup

2. **User Settings Loss:**
   - Restore from backup if available
   - Reset to sensible defaults
   - Provide easy reconfiguration UI

3. **Migration State Corruption:**
   - Reset migration state
   - Re-run migration from clean state
   - Manual data reconciliation if necessary
